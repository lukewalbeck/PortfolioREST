# Django REST API for Portfolio website

The following project serves the purpose of serving JSON files to my [portfolio site](https://lukewalbeck.github.io/)

It is built on Django Rest Framework and is running on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) for the potential of creating multiple web applications that utilize this API through GET, PUT, and POST requests. 

Currently only used for project information and potential blog posts, I intend to expand functionality beyond my resume site.
